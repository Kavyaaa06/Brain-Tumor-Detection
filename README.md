# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Aim:
To detect brain tumors from MRI images and compare the performance of a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Fuzzy CNN model that combines fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty in medical images.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Kaggle Dataset (MRI brain tumor images)

Methodology:
Collaboration & Research:
Worked with a mentor and studied IEEE research papers to understand techniques used in brain tumor detection.

Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Collected MRI brain images from Kaggle.
Applied preprocessing: resizing, normalization, noise removal.
Used data augmentation (flipping, rotating, zooming) to increase dataset size and variety.

Model Building:
Trained a CNN model to classify images with/without tumors.
Built a Fuzzy CNN by integrating fuzzy logic with CNN to better manage unclear or noisy regions in images.

Model Evaluation:
Compared models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

CNN Accuracy: ~96%
Fuzzy CNN Accuracy: ~98%

Conclusion:
The Fuzzy CNN outperformed the traditional CNN, especially in cases where tumor boundaries were not clearly visible. Integrating fuzzy logic improved the modelâ€™s ability to deal with uncertainty, making it more reliable for real-world medical image classification.
